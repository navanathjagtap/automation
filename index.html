            <h1><b>Automation Testing</b></h1>
            <h3><b>What is Automation Testing?</b></h3>
            <p>Automation testing is a systematic approach to testing software that employs automated scripts
                and tools to perform test
                cases. These automated tests run repetitive, time-consuming, and complex test scenarios to
                ensure software quality. This
                methodology enhances testing efficiency and effectiveness, allowing software development teams
                to identify defects,
                regressions, and inconsistencies more rapidly.</p>
            <h3><b>Benefits of Automation Testing:</b></h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Automation significantly accelerates the testing
                    process by executing a large number of
                    test cases in a relatively short span.</li>
                <li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Test scripts can be reused across different
                    iterations of the software, saving time
                    and resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Automated tests produce consistent and reliable
                    results, reducing the possibility of
                    human error.</li>
                <li><strong>Regression Testing:</strong> Automation is crucial for swiftly
                    identifying regressions when new features or
                    changes are introduced.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3><b>Automation Testing Process</b></h3>
            <p>The automation testing process involves the use of automated tools and scripts to execute test
                cases, compare actual
                outcomes with expected outcomes, and report results. It aims to increase testing efficiency,
                reduce human error, and
                accelerate the testing cycle in software development.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Test Planning and Strategy:</strong>
                            Define the scope of automation, identify the test cases suitable for automation, and create
                            a testing strategy. This
                            includes selecting the appropriate automation tools and frameworks, setting up testing
                            environments, and allocating resources.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>
                                Test Case Selection:</strong>
                            Choose test cases that are repetitive, time-consuming, or critical to the application. Start
                            with a subset of
                            tests that
                            will provide the most value when automated. High-priority and high-impact scenarios are
                            often preferred
                            candidates for
                            automation.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>
                                Environment Setup:</strong>
                            Configure the testing environment, including software installations, test data, databases,
                            and required
                            dependencies.
                            Ensure the environment is stable and replicates the real-world conditions in which the
                            application will be used.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>
                                Script Development:</strong>
                            Write scripts using the selected automation tool and framework. These scripts contain
                            instructions for
                            performing
                            actions like navigating through the application, interacting with UI elements, and
                            validating expected outcomes.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>
                                Test Execution:</strong>
                            Run the automated test scripts on various configurations, browsers, devices, and platforms.
                            The automation tool
                            simulates user actions and verifies the application's behavior against expected outcomes.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>
                                Result Analysis:</strong>
                            Compare actual test results with expected results. Automation tools typically generate
                            detailed test reports,
                            highlighting passed and failed tests, along with relevant screenshots or logs for further
                            analysis.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>
                                Defect Reporting:</strong>
                            For failed test cases, log defects in the defect tracking system, providing detailed
                            information about the
                            failure.
                            Include relevant logs, screenshots, and steps to reproduce the issue to help developers
                            understand and address
                            the
                            problem.

                            Investigate failed test cases to identify the root cause of failures. If issues are related
                            to the test script
                            or the
                            application under test, modify the scripts or update the application accordingly. Regularly
                            maintain and update
                            scripts
                            to accommodate changes in the application.</li>

            <h3><b>Types of Automation Frameworks:</b></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Linear Scripting Framework:</strong>
                    This is the most basic type of framework where tests are written sequentially, one after another.
                    It's
                    suitable for smaller projects with limited test cases. However, it lacks modularity and reusability,
                    making maintenance challenging as the project grows.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Modular Testing Framework:</strong>
                    In this framework, tests are divided into modules based on application functionalities. Each module
                    is a
                    separate script, making it easier to manage and reuse test cases. Changes in one module won't impact
                    others,
                    enhancing maintainability.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data-Driven Testing Framework:</strong>
                    This framework separates test data from test scripts. Test cases are written in a generic manner,
                    and data
                    is stored in external data sources like spreadsheets or databases. The same test script can be
                    executed
                    with different data sets, increasing coverage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Keyword-Driven Testing Framework:</strong>
                    In keyword-driven testing, actions or keywords represent test steps. Tests are created using a
                    combination
                    of keywords and associated data. It allows testers with minimal programming knowledge to create
                    complex tests.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Hybrid Testing Framework:</strong>
                    A hybrid framework combines the strengths of multiple frameworks. For instance, it might integrate
                    modular
                    and data-driven approaches. This type offers flexibility and can be tailored to specific project
                    requirements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) Framework:</strong>
                    BDD frameworks like Cucumber focus on collaboration between developers, testers, and non-technical
                    stakeholders. Tests are written in plain language using "Given-When-Then" syntax, making them more
                    understandable
                    by non-technical team members.

            <h1><b>API Automation</b></h1>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="column" align="left">
                    <p><strong>API (Application Programming Interface) Testing</strong> focuses on
                        verifying the functionality, reliability, and performance of APIs. APIs are sets of
                        rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and
                        interact with each other. API testing ensures that APIs work as intended, handle data
                        properly, and provide accurate responses. It's an essential aspect of ensuring the
                        overall quality of software, as APIs serve as the backbone of modern applications,
                        enabling data exchange and integrations.</p><br>
                    <p>API testing involves sending requests to API endpoints with various input data, examining
                        the responses, and validating that the results meet the expected criteria. This testing
                        can be done at various levels, including unit testing (testing individual functions or
                        methods), integration testing (testing interactions between components), and end-to-end
                        testing (testing the complete flow of data).</p><br>
                    <p>SOAP and REST are two different approaches to API design. The SOAP approach is highly
                        structured and uses XML data format. REST is more flexible and allows applications to
                        exchange data in multiple formats.</p>
                </div>
                <div align="right" class="col-lg-8">
                    <img class="img-rounded" src="image/API_TESTING.jpg" alt="API Testing" style="width: 100%;">

            <div class="row">
                <p>
                    <strong>SOAP API (Simple Object Access Protocol):</strong><br>
                    SOAP, or Simple Object Access Protocol, is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the
                    implementation of
                    web services. It's a messaging protocol that allows programs running on different operating systems
                    to communicate with
                    each other. SOAP is often used to expose application functionalities as web services over the
                    internet. SOAP messages are
                    typically formatted using XML (eXtensible Markup Language), making them platform-independent and
                    human-readable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>REST API (Representational State Transfer):</strong><br>
                    REST, or Representational State Transfer, is a style of software architecture for designing
                    networked applications.
                    RESTful APIs adhere to a set of constraints and principles, allowing for the creation, retrieval,
                    update, and
                    deletion
                    of resources over the internet. REST is often used in building web services that are lightweight,
                    scalable, and easy
                    to
                    understand. REST focuses on transferring the state of a resource between the client and server in a
                    stateless
                    manner.
                    Data is usually exchanged in formats like JSON or XML.
